# Project Brief: Electrician App

## Overview
The Electrician App is a mobile application designed to assist electricians with various tasks, including calculations, job management, inventory tracking, and documentation.

## Core Requirements
- Provide accurate electrical calculations based on NEC standards.
- Manage client information and job details.
- Track inventory and materials.
- Allow photo documentation for jobs.
- Provide access to NEC code references, formulas, and symbols.

## Goals
- Improve the accuracy and completeness of all calculators, starting with the Luminaire Layout calculator.
- Fully populate the NEC data used by the application.
- Enhance the user interface and user experience.
- Ensure data persistence and reliability.
- Maintain a well-documented codebase and project context using the Memory Bank.

## Scope
The current focus is on overhauling the Luminaire Layout calculator and completing the NEC data population. Future scope includes refining other calculators, improving job and inventory management features, and potentially adding new functionalities.
