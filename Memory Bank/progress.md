# Progress: Electrician App

## What Works
- Basic structure of the Android application with multiple modules (Calculators, Jobs, Inventory, etc.).
- Navigation between different screens.
- Basic functionality for some calculators.
- NEC data restructured into separate JSON files for specific calculators.
- Data loading mechanism updated (`NecDataRepository`, `DatabaseCallback`) to handle new JSON structure.
- Database version incremented to 49.
- **Conduit Fill Data Loading Fixed:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved the runtime issue in the Conduit Fill calculator where wire types and the initial wire entry were not loading. The calculator now loads wire types and initializes the first entry correctly.
- **Box Fill Calculation Fixed:** Successfully diagnosed and resolved the runtime issue in the Box Fill calculator where device fill calculation was blocked if conductors were not entered before devices. The calculator now correctly calculates device fill based on the largest conductor when devices are present.
- Basic job and inventory tracking features.
- Photo documentation feature.
- `README.md` updated to reflect new data structure.
- Core Memory Bank files initialized and updated.
- Deprecated Gradle properties removed from `gradle.properties`.
- Compose Material dependency added to `app/build.gradle`.
- Lint error in `VoltageDropViewModel.kt` fixed.
- **Android Gradle Plugin updated to 8.9.2.**
- **Project builds and runs successfully after manual intervention (Invalidate Caches/Restart, Gradle Sync) in Android Studio.**

## What's Left to Build
- **Verification of NEC data restructuring:** Thorough testing of calculators using the new data sources (Wire Ampacity, Voltage Drop, Box Fill, Raceway Sizing, Motor Calculator) to verify their successful integration now that the Conduit Fill and Box Fill issues are resolved.
- Comprehensive "total workover" of the Luminaire Layout calculator, including expanded CU data and interpolation.
- Addressing the persistent error in the Wire Ampacity calculator (pending verification of new data structure).
- Thorough testing and validation of all calculator logic against NEC standards.
- Potential enhancements to other modules (Jobs, Inventory, Photo Docs) based on user feedback.
- Address deprecated "is-" properties warnings from Android Gradle Plugin/dependencies for compatibility with Gradle 9.0+.

## Current Status
- NEC data restructuring completed.
- **The previous critical build failure, including the `Unresolved reference 'toDp'` error, is resolved following manual steps in Android Studio. The project now builds and runs.**
- **The runtime data loading problem in the Conduit Fill calculator has been successfully diagnosed and fixed.**
- **The runtime data loading/calculation issue in the Box Fill calculator has been successfully diagnosed and fixed.**
- Application is runnable, and the Conduit Fill and Box Fill calculators are now fully functional regarding data loading and basic calculation logic.
- Memory Bank documentation is being updated to accurately reflect the current state and focus, including the constraint of operating within VSCode.
- Deprecated "is-" properties warnings from Android Gradle Plugin/dependencies persist during build. These warnings need to be addressed for compatibility with future Gradle versions (9.0+).

## Known Issues
- Wire Ampacity calculator error for specific temperature/insulation combinations (status pending verification of new data structure).
- Luminaire calculator's CU lookup is limited (next major task after data loading issues are resolved and verification is complete).
- Ignorable "Unable to strip..." warning during build.
- Deprecated "is-" properties warnings from Android Gradle Plugin/dependencies during build. These need to be addressed by updating dependencies for Gradle 9.0+.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Completed the significant task of restructuring NEC data persistence from a single file to multiple files.
- Successfully resolved the critical build failure, including the `Unresolved reference 'toDp'` error, following manual steps in Android Studio, allowing the application to run.
- Successfully diagnosed and fixed the runtime data loading issue in the Conduit Fill calculator.
- Successfully diagnosed and fixed the runtime data loading/calculation issue in the Box Fill calculator.
- The immediate next step is to test the calculators to verify data integration.
- Updated Memory Bank to accurately reflect the current project state, including the resolved build failure, the fixed Conduit Fill and Box Fill issues, and the constraint of operating within VSCode.
- Successfully updated AGP to 8.9.2, confirming the build is stable with this version, although the "is-" property deprecation warnings remain.
