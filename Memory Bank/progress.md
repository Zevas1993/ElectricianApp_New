# Progress: Electrician App

## What Works
- Basic structure of the Android application with multiple modules (Calculators, Jobs, Inventory, etc.).
- Navigation between different screens.
- Basic functionality for some calculators (needs verification and potential workover).
- NEC data restructured into separate JSON files for specific calculators.
- Data loading mechanism updated (`NecDataRepository`, `DatabaseCallback`) to handle new JSON structure.
- Database version incremented to 49.
- Basic job and inventory tracking features.
- Photo documentation feature.
- `README.md` updated to reflect new data structure.
- Core Memory Bank files initialized and updated.
- Deprecated Gradle properties removed from `gradle.properties`.
- Compose Material dependency added to `app/build.gradle`.
- Lint error in `VoltageDropViewModel.kt` fixed.
- **Project builds successfully.**

## What's Left to Build
- **Verification of NEC data restructuring:** Thorough testing of calculators using the new data sources.
- Comprehensive "total workover" of the Luminaire Layout calculator, including expanded CU data and interpolation.
- Addressing the persistent error in the Wire Ampacity calculator (pending verification of new data structure).
- Thorough testing and validation of all calculator logic against NEC standards.
- Potential enhancements to other modules (Jobs, Inventory, Photo Docs) based on user feedback.

## Current Status
- NEC data restructuring completed.
- **Project builds successfully with deprecation warnings originating from the Android Gradle Plugin and its dependencies.** These warnings need to be addressed for compatibility with future Gradle versions (9.0+).
- Application is ready for testing to verify the successful integration of the new data structure.
- Memory Bank documentation is up-to-date with the latest changes.
- Focus is temporarily shifted from the Luminaire calculator to verifying the data restructuring.

## Known Issues
- Wire Ampacity calculator error for specific temperature/insulation combinations (status pending verification of new data structure).
- Luminaire calculator's CU lookup is limited (next major task after verification).
- Ignorable "Unable to strip..." warning during build.
- **Deprecated "is-" properties warnings from Android Gradle Plugin/dependencies during build.** These need to be addressed by updating dependencies for Gradle 9.0+.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Completed the significant task of restructuring NEC data persistence from a single file to multiple files.
- Prioritized testing the data restructuring before proceeding with the Luminaire calculator workover.
- Updated Memory Bank to accurately reflect the current project state after completing the data restructuring, addressing build issues, and documenting external deprecation warnings.
