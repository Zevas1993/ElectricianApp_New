# Product Context: Electrician App

## Purpose
The Electrician App serves as a comprehensive tool for electrical professionals, aiming to streamline their daily tasks, improve accuracy in calculations, and provide quick access to essential reference materials.

## Problem Solved
The app addresses the need for a mobile-friendly, integrated platform that combines various tools required by electricians, reducing reliance on physical code books, calculators, and disparate note-taking methods. It aims to minimize errors in calculations and provide a centralized location for job-related information.

## How it Should Work
The app should provide intuitive interfaces for each module (Calculators, Jobs, Inventory, Photo Docs, NEC Code). Users should be able to easily input data, perform calculations, save job details, manage inventory, capture and organize photos, and look up NEC references. Data should be persistent and accessible offline where possible.

## User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use:** Simple and intuitive navigation and data entry.
- **Accuracy:** Reliable calculations based on up-to-date NEC standards. The data loading and basic calculation issues in the Conduit Fill and Box Fill calculators have been resolved, contributing to improved accuracy and usability.
- **Efficiency:** Speed up common tasks like calculations and documentation. The resolution of the Conduit Fill and Box Fill calculator issues enhances efficiency for tasks requiring these calculations.
- **Organization:** Provide structured ways to manage jobs, inventory, and photos.
- **Accessibility:** Make essential NEC information readily available.
